# Web Development Immersive Orientation

## Welcome to Web Developement Immersive

We are super excited to have you as part of our flagship program here at General
Assembly! This README will provide all the information you will need to be
successfully oriented into the Web Development Immersive Program.

## Before we get started

Please be sure that your computer is up-to-date with the most recent version of
your operating system.

### OS X

Please upgrade to the latest version of OS X, El Capitan (10.11.4).

### Windows or Linux

General Assembly no longer officially supports Windows or Linux in immersive
programs. If you have a Windows or a Linux machine, you should contact your
Immersive Producer. Instructors may provide support for these operating systems
 at their own discretion.

If you are on a Windows machine, you **must** set up your computer to dual-boot
Linux Ubuntu before you can get started.  ***Running a VM will not do!***

**_Times and Events are subject to change_**

## Consultant Team Introductions

Throughout the Web Development Immersive program, you will have a dedicated team
of Consultants provide you with training, support and direction. During this
portion of Orientation you can expect to learn:

-   Names of the consultant team members
-   How long they have been with General Assembly
-   What they were doing prior to General Assembly
-   Learn an interesting fact or guilty pleasure from each
-   Learn their favorite applications and why

## Icebreakers

During this portion of orientation, we will begin to break the 'ice' and get
to know eachother a bit better!

### Two Truth's and a Lie

Here's how to play:

-   Write 3 interesting facts on the lined side of a 3x5 index card
-   Two of the facts are **true** and one of the facts will be a **lie**
-   Keep in mind that the lie should be believable like a truth and the truths
could be lies
-   Cards are collected, shuffled and passed back out
-   'Johnny' starts and reads the facts on the card he holds
-   'Johnny' has 2 guesses to indentify the person whos card he's holding
-   After 2 guess, if 'Johnny' is not correct, 'Jane' shares that it's her card
-   'Johnny' now has 2 guesses to try and pick the fact that is the **lie**
-   'Johnny' highlights which fact is the **lie** and 'Jane' on blank side of
the index card
-   'Jane' goes next and reads the facts on the card she holds
-   This continues until everyone has played!

## Alumni Panel

Let's be honest, deciding to make the life changing decision to enroll in this
full-time immersive program, most likely came with some questions and possible
doubt. This portion of orientation will give you the opportunity to hear from
alumni from past Web Development Immersive programs. You can expect to hear:

-   Names of each alumni panelist and what they were doing before WDI
-   What the alumni do now after successfully completing the program
-   What their experience was like in WDI
-   What some the challenges were that they faced during their cohorts
-   What was something they wish they knew at the start of the program
-   Open the floor up for questions

Example questions to ask:

-   What do you wish someone had told you? Would you have believed it?
-   How long was the gap in time between learning something and feeling
comfortable using it?
-   What is your learning process on-the-job?
-   How important were the projects for your learning and comfort?
-   What was it like day-to-day and week-to-week during the program?
-   How did you convince someone that you can do the job even though you
don't have experience?
-   What was your highest level of education? Did your degree matter?

## Consultant Q&A

You just heard from various WDI alumni, now is your opportunity
to ask the Consultant team questions you'd like answered. From each
Consultant, you can expect to hear:

-   More about their background and journey
-   How they began their careers in web development
-   The biggest challenge they had in starting their careers
-   Projects they've worked on

Here are some example questions you should ask:

-   What do you believe the key to success is in this program?
-   What is you personality and communication style?
-   How do I keep a positive attitude when things seem impossible?
-   Any words of wisdom before we begin this journey?

## Program Roadmap

## Expectations & Policies

We take great pride in our Web Development Immersive program! Part of the reason
is due to **very** clear expectations and policies we have in place. You will
these below.

First a foremost, to be successful in this program, it is **imperative** that
you understand what a **_Growth Mindset_** is and practice having a  **_Growth
Mindset_**

Growth Mindset:
[Growth Mindset](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8379295/15218249/feed4808-182c-11e6-8c62-4ce78903bee9.png)

The image above is a great visual representation of what each of you will go
through **several times** during this program! It is also a great visual of what
makes a Growth Minded individual!

### MUST SEE

[The power of belief: Mindset & Success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc)

Below you'll find the Expectations we have for you, as aspiring developers in
this program:

The goal of the program is not to produce working code, **working code is a
by-product of the goal.** The goal of the program is to learn how to create
working code.

#### Diagnostics

1.  Diagnostics will be given regularly, and are designed to reflect
recently-covered material
2.  These diagnostics scores will not impact your completion; they are a tool
for you and us to gauge your comprehension of the material
3   **Don't stress out about these diagnostics, and don't obsess over the results**

#### Practice

-   Practice will be assigned semi-regularly, and will be assessed in terms of:

    -   Code quality (e.g. indentation, good comments, readability, etc.)
    -   Functionality (Does it run correctly? Is it robust? Is it efficient?)

-   However, as important as doing your practice work is, remember that the
most important thing is what you're learning.

#### Professionalism

-   We will treat you like adults and expect you to behave like adults.
-   Disagreements with other students should be resolved on your own.
-   As with every rule, there are exceptions. If any student is behaving in a
way that is disrespectful and/or dangerous towards their fellow developers,
that should be brought to the producer's attention immediately. Similarly,
any issues that involved consultants should be brought to the producer's
attention

#### Independence

-   We will do our best to train you with everything we can in the time we have.
 However, the ultimate responsibility for what you learn lies with you.
-   If you're having trouble with material, ask questions. See out consultants
outside of class. Find extra tutorials online.
-   If you're ahead, ask for more work!

#### Attendance

##### Late arrivals/Early departures
-   If you arrive after 9:15am (Program beings at 9:00am) you are late. Any
training missed is your responsibility to make up.
-   If you leave before 5:00pm, you have left early.
-   If you're late arrivals and early departures exceed 5, you will not
successfully complete the program.

##### Absences
-   If you miss more than 3 days regardless of reason, you will not successfully
complete the program
-   If you know of a planned absence(s), please contract the producer ASAP

#### Successful Completion Requirements

-   Program Attendance
-   Successful completion of ALL projects
-   Submission of all Assignments
-   Outcomes Programming Attendance
-   Outcomes Programming Participation

#### Rewards for Successful Completion

-   Outcomes Support
-   Participation in the Meet & Hire Letter and Certificate of Completion
-   Participation in sem-anual Graduation Celebration
-   You may also request a reference or recommendation from Consultants

## Workspace Culture

Break into groups of three or four. In your group, discuss and outline your
expectations of each other as colleagues. Then, we'll share what each group has
discussed and record a social contract.

Most groups of developers come up with something like the following:

-   Respect is mutually given, not earned; follow [Wheaton's
    Law](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law)
-   Be an open communicator; do not disengage when working in a group, and
    practice active listening.
-   Be open to constructive feedback; when giving feedback, be specific.
-   Take others' intent into account; follow [Hanlon's
    Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor).
-   Be collaborative, share freely, and respect others' abilities and
    preferences.
-   Maintain a growth mindset and a good attitude.
-   Ask lots of questions, but do your due diligence!
-   Leave outside stress and your ego at the door.
-   Foster a space where it safe to fail and learn from mistakes.
-   Have fun!

## Staff Introductions

Majority of your experiences in the program workspace will have interactions
with the consultant, production, outcomes and operations teams. However, there
are addition departments working hard, behind the scenes, to ensure your
experience along with that of future programs are the best they possibly can be.
This portion will allow you to meet some addition friendly faces that you will
see around campus. This includes:

-   Senior Leadership
-   Marketing
-   Partnerships
-   Classes, Events & Workshops
-   Admissions
-   Product
-   Other Immersive Programs

## Operations

## Outcomes

One of the great perks of this Immersive program would be the Outcomes support
you receive upon successful completion of the Web Development Immersive Program.
You will have a chance to hear from you Outcomes Producer and to get a high
level snapshot of what you can expect for Outcomes throughout the course.

You will have much more information provided during your first Outcomes
Programming session, so not to worry if every question you have is not answered
during this segment!

## Installfest

Follow these instructions to set up your laptop for work in WDI. If you've
previously set up a development environment on your computer, you may wish to
skip some of these steps; **do not do so** without first checking with an
instructor!

If at any point you are unsure of whether you have done something correctly,
ask an instructor. It's important in many cases that we do these steps in order.

## OS X (Only)

OS X ships with utilities that are slightly different from standard Linux tools.
To smooth out *some* of the differences, we need to change how OS X loads our
shell (`bash`) configuration.

1.Check if you have a `.bashrc` file in your home directory. Open your terminal
and type:

```bash
ls ~/.bashrc
```

***IF*** you receive a warning saying no such file or directory exists type:

```bash
touch ~/.bashrc
```

This creates an empty file for us.

2.Check if you have a `.bash_profile` in your home directory. Open your
terminal and type

```bash
ls ~/.bash_profile
```

***IF*** you receive a warning saying no such file or directory exists type:

```bash
touch ~/.bash_profile
```

3.Execute the follow commands at the terminal:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Next, we'll look at `.bash_profile` to make sure it has the contents we expect.
Type the following in the terminal to look at the contents of the file:

```bash
cat ~/.bash_profile
```

Near the bottom, you should have something that looks like this:

```bash
# ~/.bash_profile

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

4.You will also need to update `/etc/paths` by running the following commands:

```bash
echo '/\/usr\/local\/bin/\nd\nwq' | sudo ed /etc/paths
echo '1i\n/usr/local/bin\n.\nwq' | sudo ed /etc/paths
```

5.Finally, let's inspect our changes by typing:

```bash
cat /etc/paths
```

It should look like this:

```bash
# /etc/paths

/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
```

## Homebrew

Those of you who are on Ubuntu already have a powerful package manager, `apt`,
built into your operating system. However, OS X doesn't come with a package
manager installed, so we'll be installing a 3rd-party package manager called
Homebrew to install software from the command line. ***If you're running Linux,
please hold tight until we get to the section on Atom.***

## Command Line Tools

In order for Homebrew to work, we'll need to rely on a number of programs that
come pre-installed on Linux. Install these tools **via the terminal** using the
command:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

This may require that you run a Software Update before proceeding.

### Install Homebrew

1.First, enter this command into your terminal:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2.Homebrew has a built-in diagnostic tool to determine if it's working
correctly; you can run it by entering the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew doctor
```

**NOTE: YOUR SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY THROW SOME ERRORS HERE!** Some of these
errors are probably minor, but some might not be; please wait until one of the
instructors has given you the go-ahead before moving on.

3.Once Homebrew says `Your system is ready to brew`, run the following command
update Homebrew's directory of packages.

```bash
brew update
```

4.Install Brew Cask, a Homebrew add-on for installing GUI applications
from the command line.

```bash
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
```

5.Lastly, install tidy-html5

```bash
brew install tidy-html5
```

## Atom

The text editor we'll be using in this course is called **Atom**; it was
developed by the GitHub team, and is highly extensible.

***Note: From this point forward you will open Atom from the command line***

#### OS X & Linux

Download Atom from [Atom.io](https://atom.io/)

#### Linux ONLY

Once finished run the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
```

### Atom Add-Ons

We're going to use Atom's package manager, `apm`, to add a number of helpful
extensions to your Atom installation. For each package listed below, run
`apm install <name-of-package>` in the terminal to perform the installation.

```bash
  apm install aligner
```

```bash
  apm install aligner-scss
```

```bash
  apm install aligner-css
```

Now that we have some practice with running the 'apm install <package_name>' we
do a shortcut where is runs the same command but installs all packages in one go!

```bash
apm install aligner-ruby atom-beautify atom-jshint editorconfig esformatter fixmyjs git-diff-details git-history git-plus language-ember-htmlbars language-markdown less-than-slash linter linter-csslint linter-eslint linter-markdown linter-rubocop linter-ruby linter-scss-lint linter-tidy markdown-writer sort-lines
```

## Installing NVM and Node/NPM

We're going to be installing Node next; Node (and its various packages) will be
the foundation of a large part of the course. First, though, we're going to
download a tool called [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) that allows us
to maintain multiple different versions of Node, in case we want to switch
between them for different projects. Then we'll download Node, and use its
associated package manager, NPM, to download and install the following Node
modules:

- JShint, a tool for testing JavaScript code quality. (`jshint`)
- Grunt, a tool for automating background tasks. (`grunt-cli`)


#### OS X

```bash
brew install nvm
```

#### Linux

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.1/install.sh | bash
```

1.  Open your `.bashrc` file by typing `open .bashrc` and paste in the
    following:

    ```bash
    # OS X
    export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
    source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
    ```

    ```bash
    # Ubuntu
    export NVM_DIR="/home/$(whoami)/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
    ```

1.  Use NVM to install the latest longterm stable version of Node (4.4.4)

    ```bash
    nvm install v4
    nvm alias lts v4
    nvm alias default lts ## or, if v5 is already installed:
                          # nvm alias default v4
                          ## then,
    nvm use default
    ```

1.  Restart your Terminal by quitting the application and re-opening it.

1.  Finally, use NPM to install the Node modules mentioned earlier and make them
    available across all of our projects.

    ```bash
    npm install -g npm
    npm install -g jshint
    ```

    Just like we did before with the Atom packages install, we can string
    together the various packages we'd like installed into one executable
    command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g jsonlint grunt-cli remark-lint jscs bower ember
    ```

## Git (and GitHub)

If you haven't done so already, go to [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and create
and account; be sure to write down your username and password somewhere, since
we'll be using these credentials later.

***Please paste your GitHub username in the `projects` slack channel.*** You
will be added to a cohort GitHub team.

#### OS X

Enter the command `brew install git`.

#### Linux

Enter the command `sudo apt-get install git`.

## Configuring Git

Now let's take care of some settings.

1.Show the current Git branch in the terminal prompt, and tweak Git's EDITOR
variable so that commit message pop-ups open in Atom. Run the command:

```bash
atom ~/.bashrc
```

2.Paste the following code into the bottom of the file:

```bash
# Git
function parse_git_branch {
  ref=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null) || return
  echo "("${ref#refs/heads/}")"
}
export PS1="\w \$(parse_git_branch)\$ "
export EDITOR='atom --wait'
export VISUAL='atom --wait'
```

3.Colorize git in the command line

```bash
git config --global color.ui true
```

4.Set up a global 'excludesfile', listing all the files that we might want git
to ignore.

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
echo ".DS_Store" >> ~/.gitignore
```

5.Configure Git

```bash
git config --global user.name "<yourUsername>"
git config --global user.email "<your_email@example.com>"
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
git config --global push.default simple
git config --global branch.autosetupmerge true
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

## Linking with GitHub

In order to push commits to GitHub from the command line, we need Git and
GitHub to have a matching set of SSH keys.

1.Generate a new key by running

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "<your_email@example.com>"
```

(Feel free to put in a password or select a non-default location for your keys,
but it's not necessary to do so; to move ahead, just keep hitting `enter`).

2.Add this new key to your system by running:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

3.Copy the new key to your clipboard using either:

#### OSX

```bash
  pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

#### Linux

```bash
  xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

4.Log into GitHub.com, go to [https://github.com/settings/ssh](https://github.com/settings/ssh),
and paste in your SSH key. To test it out, type the following into the command
line:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If you get a prompt along the lines of

```bash
The authenticity of host 'github.com (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)'... can\'t be established.
RSA key fingerprint is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Just type 'yes'. If everything's working, you should get a response like the
following:

```bash
Hi yourUsername! You\'ve succesfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
## Install [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub)

> hub is a command line tool that wraps git in order to extend it with extra
> features and commands that make working with GitHub easier. -- [`hub`
> README](https://github.com/github/hub).

```bash
brew install hub
```

After installing `hub`, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`.

```bash
eval "$(hub alias -s)"
```

## Rbenv, Ruby, and Rails


Rbenv is a tool that we can use to manage multiple versions of Ruby and
determine which version we use for a particular project.

1.Install Rbenv

#### OS X

```bash
brew install rbenv
```

#### Linux

Copy and paste this entire line into your terminal and run it.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer/master/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```

2.Tell Rbenv to use homebrew's directories instead of rbenv's

#### OS X

`Open ~/.bashrc` and paste in the following code ***BEFORE*** the stuff you pasted
in about Git.

```bash
# Rbenv
export RBENV_ROOT=/usr/local/var/rbenv
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

#### Linux

`Open ~/.bashrc` and paste in the following code BEFORE the stuff you pasted
in about Git.

```bash
# Rbenv
export RBENV_ROOT="${HOME}/.rbenv"
if [ -d "${RBENV_ROOT}" ]; then
  export PATH="${RBENV_ROOT}/bin:${PATH}"
  eval "$(rbenv init -)"
fi
```

3.Once you've done this, run the following command to reload the terminal's
settings:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

4.***Note: after installing gems you may need to run this command***

#### OS X and Linux

```bash
rbenv rehash
```

#### Linux

Rbenv on Linux depends on another library called `libffi-dev`. Download and
install it with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

5.Install `ruby-build`, a plugin for rbenv.

#### OS X

```bash
brew install ruby-build
```

#### Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

Don't worry if the above step doesn't take. Some Linux machines may not need it.

6.Install version 2.3.0 of Ruby and make it the system-wide default using the
command:

```bash
rbenv install 2.3.0 && rbenv global 2.3.0
```

You can see what versions of Ruby rbenv has downloaded by running
`rbenv versions`; to see which version you are currently using, type either
`rbenv version` or `ruby -v`.

## From Ruby to Rails (and more)

Now that you have Ruby installed, you can begin to install gems on your own.
However, gems usually come with a lot of unnecessary documentation - let's tell
Ruby to skip those by running the following command:

```bash
echo 'gem: --no-document' >> ~/.gemrc
```

Next, we'll go ahead and install Rails.

```bash
gem install rails
```

Here are a couple of other gems we should also install.

```bash
gem install bundler
gem install rubocop
gem install scss_lint
```


## Postgres

Next, we'll download Postgres, a database program that we'll be using for most
of the course.

1.First, download and install Postgres.

#### OS X

```bash
brew install postgres
```

#### Linux

Run to install Postgres and its dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev
```

2.Then, configure your new Postgres installation by entering the following
lines into the console:

#### OS X

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents

ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

createdb `whoami`
```

#### Linux

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser `whoami` -s

sudo -u postgres createdb `whoami`
```

Type `\q` to quit postgres

See [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL) if you run into any issues with the installation.

> Whether you're on OS X or Linux, you can test your configuration by running
> `psql` in the console.

3.Finally, install the `pg` gem from the command line so that Ruby programs
can communicate with Postgres.

```bash
gem install pg
```

## Other Goodies

#### OS X

```bash
brew install libsass
```

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsass
```
